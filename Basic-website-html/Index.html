            <li>vet expenses(insurance)</li>
            <li>cat toys</li>
        </ul>

        <div align="center">
        <b>Estimated Monthly Budget:</b>
        <table border="1" cellpadding="10" cellspacing="0">
            <tr>
                <th>Litter</th>
                <th>Cat Food</th>
                <th>Vet Expenses(insurance)</th>
                <th>Cat Toys</th>
                <th>Treats</th>

                <td>$10</td>
            
            </tr>
            
        </table>
